# Protein Structure Prediction and Stability Analysis

This repository contains a Streamlit web application for protein structure prediction and stability analysis using a Transformer-GNN model. The app integrates ESM-2 embeddings and various molecular visualization tools to provide insights into protein structures, residue interactions, and stability factors.


# Features

Protein Structure Prediction: Uses a Transformer-GNN model to predict protein structures based on sequence data.

Molecular Visualization: Interactive 3D visualization of protein structures.

Residue-Level Contact Maps: Displays interactions between residues.

Secondary Structure Interactions: Identifies and visualizes secondary structural elements.

Ramachandran Plots: Analyzes backbone dihedral angles for structure validation.

Stability Estimation: Evaluates environmental factors affecting protein stability.

API Integration: Fetches protein structure and sequence data dynamically.
